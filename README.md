# self-driving-car

A neural network liberary using matrices and vectors.
It has the ability to train the networks without the user having to know how it works in particular. We will use it for our self-driving-car project at our school.

I'm happy about any suggestions.Please feel free to comment in the issues section or just send me a mail.
